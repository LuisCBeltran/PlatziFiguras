## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- Pug
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- How to use JavaScript to program a basic calculator and to implement it within a web page.
- Consolidation and practice of current CSS/Sass and HTML knowledge. 

### Continued development

This was my first attempt with JavaScript. I think I dit it okey, but I need more practice with the language. More complex projects using JavaScript are imperative.
